# Temporal Jitter Problem in Current Simulator

## The Problem

Our simulator runs at 60 FPS, which means:
- Events are only checked every ~16.67ms
- A key press can happen anywhere within that 16.67ms window
- But we only detect it at the next frame boundary

## Visual Example

```
Frame 1                    Frame 2                    Frame 3
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
     ↑                          ↑
     User presses key           Pygame detects it
     (5ms into frame)           (start of next frame)
     
     <----- 11.67ms delay ----->
```

## Why This Destroys ERP Quality

### 1. ERP Components Are Time-Locked
```
True neural response timeline:
0ms: User sees error
250ms: Error negativity (Ne/ERN) peaks
350ms: Error positivity (Pe) peaks

With 16.67ms jitter:
0-16.67ms: User sees error (uncertain when)
250-266.67ms: Ne/ERN smeared across this range
350-366.67ms: Pe smeared across this range
```

### 2. Averaging Makes It Worse
When you average 100 trials:
- Each trial has random 0-16.67ms offset
- Components blur and reduce in amplitude
- Sharp peaks become rounded bumps
- Latency measurements become unreliable

### 3. Real Impact on Your Data

**Without jitter (ideal)**:
- Ne/ERN: -8µV peak at exactly 250ms
- Clear, sharp component

**With 16.67ms jitter (current)**:
- Ne/ERN: -5µV smeared peak around 240-260ms
- 37% amplitude reduction!
- Harder to detect statistically

## Current Code Problem

```python
# Current implementation (frame-based)
for event in pygame.event.get():  # Only checked once per frame!
    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        key_event_ts = push_immediate(f"KEY_{intended_action}")
        # Timestamp is precise, but event already 0-16.67ms old!
```

## The Solution

### Option 1: High-Frequency Event Thread
```python
import threading
import queue

class PrecisionEventHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.event_queue = queue.Queue()
        self.running = True
        
    def event_thread(self):
        """Run at 1000Hz for 1ms precision"""
        while self.running:
            # Check for events every 1ms
            events = pygame.event.get()
            for event in events:
                timestamp = time.perf_counter()
                self.event_queue.put((timestamp, event))
            time.sleep(0.001)  # 1ms
    
    def get_events(self):
        """Main thread retrieves timestamped events"""
        events = []
        while not self.event_queue.empty():
            events.append(self.event_queue.get())
        return events
```

### Option 2: Hardware Timestamps (Better)
```python
# Use pygame's event.timestamp if available
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if hasattr(event, 'timestamp'):
        # SDL2 provides hardware timestamps
        actual_time = event.timestamp / 1000.0  # Convert to seconds
    else:
        # Fallback
        actual_time = time.perf_counter()
```

### Option 3: Psychopy Instead of Pygame
- Psychopy is designed for psychology experiments
- Has built-in sub-millisecond timing
- Used in most EEG/ERP studies

## Critical for Your Research

**This is THE most important technical issue** because:

1. **ErrP peaks are at specific latencies** (250ms, 350ms)
2. **16.67ms jitter is 6.7% of your main component**
3. **Reviewers will ask about timing precision**
4. **Cannot be fixed in post-processing**

## Quick Test to Verify

```python
# Add this to your code to measure actual jitter
reaction_times = []
for trial in range(100):
    # Show stimulus
    stim_time = time.perf_counter()
    # Wait for response
    # ...
    response_time = time.perf_counter()
    rt = (response_time - stim_time) * 1000
    reaction_times.append(rt)

# Check if RTs cluster at 16.67ms intervals
plt.hist(reaction_times, bins=50)
# If you see peaks every 16.67ms, you have frame-based timing
```

## Bottom Line

For publication-quality ERP research, you need <2ms timing precision. Current 16.67ms jitter is unacceptable and will significantly degrade your ERP data quality. This should be the #1 priority fix.
